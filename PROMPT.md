   Implement search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to enhance the website's visibility and effectiveness for marketing purposes.

3. **Support Hebrew and English with RTL/LTR**

4. **Ensure Mobile Compatibility**  
   Make the website fully responsive to provide seamless support across mobile devices and various screen sizes.

5. **Prepare for GitHub Pages Deployment**

9. **Base Content on Existing Website**  
   Use the current website at https://www.naftaligan.co.il/ as the foundation for content and structure, adapting and improving as needed.

10. **Automate Deployment with GitHub Action**
